# E90: Low Cost Embedded DSP Development Platform

Development board for rapid audio DSP application prototyping or to be used as an accessible educational tool in an introductory DSP or Embedded Systems course.

The board supports stereo 24bit audio at 48kHz sampling and implements a highly optimized DMA audio stream scheme. The STM32F407 has been configured to run at the maximum rate of 168 MHz wich is derived from an external high speed crystal oscillator (16 MHz) on my PCB.
