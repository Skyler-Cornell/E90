# E90: Low Cost Embedded DSP Development Platform

The product is intended for rapid DSP application prototyping or to be used as an accessible educational tool in an introductory DSP or Embedded Systems course.
My goal is for the board to be a fully functional DSP able to work at audio sample rates (up to 96 kHz sampling rate). 
The final development platform will be a printed circuit board coupled with a C library providing API level control of the system.
I expect the project to cost approximately $300 which will cover the cost of expedited PCB manufacturing and the circuit components for at least three rounds of prototyping. 

###TODO:
Hardware:

-Accel/Gyro
-ADC user input
-External SRAM
-Program MCU directly with USB cable

Audio Library Firmware:

-Wavetable synthesis with linear interpolation
-Filter designer
-Gyro synthesizer (just for fun)
-Reverb
-System modeler + copy cat
-Data logging and real time digital signal visualization
